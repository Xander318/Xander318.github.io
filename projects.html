            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Xander318/Othello/">Othello</a></h4>
            <p>Developed command-line version of the boardgame Othello, written in Haskell.
              Playable by 2 players or 1 player against an AI that looks ahead 4 moves.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Xander318/Tac_OS">Tac_OS</a></h4>
            <p>Simple Operating System, written in C, consisting of a kernel, shell & file system.
              I shared responsibility for the kernel which maintains all of the state of the processes being handled by the operating system over six different queues: 3 scheduling queues of priority -1, 0 and 1 (queue_1, queue_2, and queue_3 respectively), a queue of sleeping processes called 'sleep', a queue of blocked processes called 'blocked', and a queue of stopped processes called 'stopped'. Using these queues and the pcb_t data structures that they contain, we are able to perform a number of operations such as spawning a new process, killing a process, resetting a process's priority, and other process-related functions.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Xander318/OpenDesk">OpenDesk</a></h4>
            <p>Built Node.js web application to predict the availability of study spaces at the
              University of Pennsylvania using a Decision Tree Regressor. The user can provide
              feedback as to whether the prediction was helpful thus tuning the DTR over time
              to yield more accurate predictions.

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Xander318/Tripster/">Tripster</a></h4>
            <p>Social networking site to facilitate trip planning. Users can create a trip, post photos
              and other content, invite users to trips, like content, and see all of this in a newsfeed.
              Users can also search for other users, user's photos or trip locations. There is a
              MongoDB-backed cache to reduce look-up time for already-searched items.
